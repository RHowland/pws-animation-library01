Naming Conventions for the njs-base-app01 app. 

Database Tables
- Use singular names:
   customer (preferred) vs customers (not preferred)
- For multi word names, use snake case: words 
  separated by underscore character.
  Example: cust_address

Table Column Names
- Use the Table Prefix at the beginning of 
  column names.  (See data_column_prefixes.txt)

React Component Names
- Use Pascal case for each component name and the  
  name for the file that contains that component.
  - Pascal names, start with upper case letter
  Example: A component to send an email message 
  should be given a pascal name like this: 
  SendEmailMessage.  And the file containing this 
  component should have the same name 
  "SendEmailMessage.tsx" 

Next.js Webpage Components
These naming guidelines were taken from the 
Airbnb Javascript Style Guide.
- For each webpage component, append the word "Page" 
  to the end of the folder name *and* the component 
  name.  
  Examples: HomePage, AboutPage, ContactPage.
- In Next.js, for web page files (all of which must 
  be named page.tsx), give the parent folder the 
  same pascal-case name as the component name. 
  About page example: 
  - To configure the About page, under the app folder, 
    - Create a new folder named  "AboutPage".  
    - In this folder, create the "page.tsx" file to 
      hold the AboutPage component.  Then, inside the 
      page.tsx file, name this component "AboutPage".
