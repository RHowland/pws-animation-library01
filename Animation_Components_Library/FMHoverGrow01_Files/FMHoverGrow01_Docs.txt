FMHoverGro01_Docs.txt
---------------------
   This file contains documentation for the FMHoverGrow01 
   component.  

   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   What Does This Component Do?
   ----------------------------
   This component will cause the wrapped child components, 
   usually a button or a card, to grow larger when the mouse 
   pointer hovers over the button or card.  When the mouse 
   pointer hovers away from that item, it will shrink back 
   to its original size. 


   Properties for this component:
   ------------------------------
   Property     Property                Property
   Name         Value                   Description
   -----------  ----------------------  ----------------------------
   transition   { duration: number }    Duration of the scaling animation
   whileHover   { scale: number }       Scale factor applied on hover





   How to Configure These Properties
   ---------------------------------
   See the FMFadeInSection01Props.ts file for details about how to 
   configure these properties.



   What are typical values for these properties?
   ---------------------------------------------
   transition: { duration: 1 } - Duration of 1 second for the scaling animation.
   whileHover: { scale: 1.1 } - Scales the component by 10% on hover.




   Caution Notes
   --------------------------------

   Do not set whileHover scale to a negative value, which could invert the component visually.
   Ensure that the transition duration is balanced to provide a smooth hover effect.


   Interactions or Conflicts Between Properties?
   ---------------------------------------------
   - No direct conflicts between transition and whileHover properties.
   - Ensure that whileHover scale is distinct enough to provide a noticeable hover effect.



   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   Example Code Section
   --------------------
   Provide some example code to show how to install this component.

   <FMHoverGrow01>
     <button className="button">Click Me</button>

   Customize the hover effect animation by passing optional props:

   <FMHoverGrow01
     transition={{ duration: 1 }}
     whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }}>
     <img src="example.png" alt="Example Image" />
   </FMHoverGrow01>

   Troubleshooting Section:
   ------------------------
   Describe situations or conditions that can cause this 
   motion component to either not work at all or to work 
   incorrectly. 

   - Ensure that motion from 'framer-motion' is correctly imported and utilized in your project.
   - Verify that all required props (transition, whileHover) are provided and correctly configured.
   - Check for conflicting CSS styles or JavaScript that may interfere with the hover animation.
   - Debug any JavaScript errors that could prevent the component from functioning as expected.
   - Test in different environments to identify performance issues or browser-specific quirks.


   Typical beginner mistakes:
   --------------------------
   - Forgetting to wrap child components within <FMHoverGrow01>.
   - Misconfiguring the transition or whileHover props, leading to unexpected behavior.


   Unusual errors:
   ---------------
   - Hover effect not triggering due to incorrect use of whileHover prop.
   - Unexpected scaling behavior if transition duration is too short or whileHover scale is too extreme.
