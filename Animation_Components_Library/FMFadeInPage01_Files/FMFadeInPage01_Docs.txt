FMFadeInPage01_Docs.txt
-----------------------
   This file contains documentation for the FMFadeInPage01 
   component.  

   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   What Does This Component Do?
   ----------------------------
   This component will cause the wrapped child components 
   to fade in (as a unit) when the web page is first loaded 
   or when it is refreshed.


   Properties for this component:
   ------------------------------
   Property     Property                Property
   Name         Value                   Description
   -----------  ----------------------  ----------------------------
   initial:     { opacity: number };    Initial state of the animation
   animate:     { opacity: number };    Target state of the animation
   exit:        { opacity: number };    State when the component exits
   transition:  { duration: number };   Duration of the transition





   How to Configure These Properties
   ---------------------------------
   See the FMFadeInPage01Props.ts file for details about how to 
   configure these properties.


   What are typical values for these properties?
   ---------------------------------------------
    initial: { opacity: 0 } - Start opacity at 0.
    animate: { opacity: 1 } - End opacity at 1.
    exit: { opacity: 0 } - Exit opacity at 0.
    transition: { duration: 1 } - Duration of 1 second.


   Caution Notes:
   --------------
    Do not set initial and animate values too close together:

    Example: Avoid setting both initial and animate to { opacity: 1 }.
    Make certain that initial and animate values are distinct, such as 
    initial: { opacity: 0 } and animate: { opacity: 1 }, to ensure the 
    fade-in effect is visible.
    Do not set transition duration too short or too long:

    Example: Avoid setting transition: { duration: 0.1 } or 
    transition: { duration: 10 }.
    Make certain to choose a balanced duration, like transition: { duration: 1 },
     to achieve a smooth and noticeable animation.
    Do not overlook potential conflicts with other animations:

    Example: Avoid using multiple animations on the same element that could conflict.
    Make certain to test the component in the context of your entire page to ensure it 
    interacts well with other animations and transitions.
    Do not forget to wrap all child components correctly:

    Example: Avoid placing the FMFadeInPage01 component outside the main structure of your page.
    Make certain to wrap all relevant child components within FMFadeInPage01 to apply the fade-in effect properly.
    Do not ignore consistency across different pages:

    Example: Avoid using drastically different animation settings on different pages.
    Make certain to maintain consistent property settings across your site to ensure a uniform user experience.




   Interactions or Conflicts Between Properties?
   ---------------------------------------------

    initial and animate:

    Interaction: Define the start and end states of the animation.
    Conflict: If too similar, the animation may not be noticeable.


    initial and exit:

    Interaction: Define entry and exit states.
    Conflict: If identical, no noticeable change during mount/unmount.


    animate and exit:

    Interaction: Define active and exit states.
    Conflict: Drastically different values can cause abrupt transitions.


    transition:

    Interaction: Affects timing of all animations.
    Conflict: Too short makes the animation too fast; too long makes it sluggish.

   Example Code Section
   --------------------
   Provide some example code to show how to install this component.


   To use this component to perform fade in effects on all 
   web pages in a website, use this component to wrap all 
   child components in the main layout.tsx file. 

   src/app/layout.tsx            

   return (
     <html lang='en'>
       <body className={inter.className}>
         <FMFadeInPage01>
           <Navbar />
           {children}
           <div className=' xl:mt-24'>
             <Footer />
           </div>
         </FMFadeInPage01>
       </body>
     </html>
   );  


   To use this component to perform fade in effects on 
   a SINGLE web page, wrap this component around all  
   child components in the page.tsx file for that web 
   page. 

   page.tsx  

   return (
     <main>
       <FMFadeInPage01>
          </HeroSection>
          </FeaturesSection>
          </CustomerReviewSection>
          </CallToActioniSection>
       </FMFadeInPage01>
     </main>
   );

   Troubleshooting Section:
   ------------------------
   Describe situations or conditions that can cause this 
   motion component to either not work at all or to work 
   incorrectly. 

   Missing or Incorrect Property Values:

    Situation: If the required properties (initial, animate, exit, transition) are not provided or are set incorrectly.
    Condition: Ensure all properties are provided with valid values. Example: initial={{ opacity: 0 }}, animate={{ opacity: 1 }}, transition={{ duration: 1 }}.
   
   Incorrect Placement in the Component Tree:

    Situation: If the FMFadeInPage01 component is not placed correctly around child components.
    Condition: Make sure to wrap the component correctly around all relevant child components in layout.tsx or page.tsx.
    
   Conflicting CSS or JavaScript Animations:

    Situation: If there are other CSS or JavaScript animations affecting the same elements.
    Condition: Ensure there are no conflicting animations that could override or interfere with the fade-in effect.
    
   JavaScript Errors:

    Situation: If there are JavaScript errors in the application that prevent components from rendering.
    Condition: Check the console for errors and resolve any issues that might prevent the component from functioning.
    
   Incorrect Use of Framer Motion:

    Situation: If Framer Motion is not correctly imported or used.
    Condition: Make sure to import motion from Framer Motion and use it correctly within the component.
   
   Pathname Dependency Issues:

    Situation: If the usePathname hook does not return the correct path or if the key prop is not used correctly.
    Condition: Verify that usePathname returns the correct path and that the key prop is correctly set to trigger re-renders on path changes.
  
   Performance Issues:

    Situation: If the animations are causing performance issues, particularly on low-end devices.
    Condition: Optimize the animations and ensure they run smoothly on all targeted devices.
  
   Unsupported Browser Features:

    Situation: If the user's browser does not support required features for animations.
    Condition: Ensure browser compatibility and consider using polyfills if necessary.


   Typical beginner mistakes:
   --------------------------
    Not wrapping the component around child components correctly.
    Incorrectly setting the properties.


   Unusual errors:
   ---------------
    Animation not triggering due to conflicts with other animations or page transitions.
    Unexpected behavior if default property values are not provided and the component is used without specifying all props.
