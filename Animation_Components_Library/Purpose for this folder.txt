Animation Components Library Folder

The purpose for this folder is to serve as a 
known storage location for CHILD folders that 
contain a complete set of documentation and 
files that make up different animation 
components.  

Developers will be directed to go to the child 
folders under this folder to get the assets and 
documentation that are needed to install one of 
these components into a new web app.
