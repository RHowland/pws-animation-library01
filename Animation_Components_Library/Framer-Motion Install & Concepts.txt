Framer-Motion Install & Concepts.txt

The purpose of this document is to help a developer, 
who is new to Framer-Motion to get off to a good 
start using this library.  

The install is extremely simple and we will cover that 
below.  

Unfortunately, getting an understanding of how this 
library works is a little more difficult due to the 
poor organization of the Framer-Motion documentation.  

So, we have provided a concepts section to, hopefully, 
help to better understand how to use this library. 

=======================================================
1. Install Framer-Motion

   Prerequisites:
   - Next.js starter app using React 18.

   Install Command for React 18 and earlier: 
     npm install framer-motion   



   Install Command for React 19:
     npm install framer-motion@12.0.0-alpha.0


   That's it, nothing else to do to install.

2. Framer Motion Concepts

We had planned on creating a short but complete overview 
of the Framer Motion library so we went searching the 
Internet to try to find some good information.  

However, the following articles and videos will do a much 
better job at explaining and demonstrating the concepts 
behind the Frame Motion library.
