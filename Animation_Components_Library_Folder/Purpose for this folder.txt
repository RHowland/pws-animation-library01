Animation Components Library Folder

The purpose for this folder is to serve as a known 
storage location for child folders that contain the 
latest versions of multiple animation components.  

Developers will be directed to go to the child folders 
under this folder to get the assets and documentation 
that are needed to install one of these components into 
a customer's web app.
